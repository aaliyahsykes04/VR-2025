# intro 
#the game is about alien who want to destroy the timeline in order for a better chance to take over the Earth in the present.

# mechanics
# what the player will do in the game 
#The player will go through portal to battle the invading aliens and protect their timeline and future

# dynamics
# what changes in the experience to make it a game/the challenge
#The alien will be dressed like human so it will be harder to recoginize them as aliens.

# aestethetics
# the general look and vibe 
# Since the alien will be traveling through the timeline it gives me the space to incorporate different aestethetics into this game. A few timelines I would like to use is the Renaissance, Samauris, and Pirates. The "present" will be set years into our future maybe 20540-ish.
